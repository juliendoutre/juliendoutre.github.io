[{"content":"I wanted to have my own blog for a long time. Finally, some day last week, I found the time to set up one. This article will reflect on my thought process and the stack I ended up choosing.\nMy requirements were pretty straigthforward. I wanted:\nto write posts using just markdown. I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of fancy text editors, they\u0026rsquo;re not reactive enough. Being able to write in my IDE (vscode) where I already manage my code and my terminal makes it easier for me to gather all my tools at the same place. to host the website myself, not just posting on Medium or Wordpress for instance. I wanted to be able to control the very content I would expose publically from the articles\u0026rsquo; body to the pages\u0026rsquo; HTML. the solution to be as cheap as possible. Do I really need to elaborate? Additionally, I did not want to build something from scratch, especially not relying on JS frameworks like React which are way too overkill for small projects. Moreover I\u0026rsquo;m not a frontend engineer, I\u0026rsquo;m really bad at drawing with CSS (I still struggle centering \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; inside flex boxes, how do these guys have their tags behave as they want them to?! ðŸ¤¯).\nNaturally, the go-to for static websites supporting markdown is Hugo. It did not take me a lot of time to realize it was a perfect fit for my use case:\nbrew install hugo hugo new site juliendoutre.github.io and I had my project initialized.\nhugo serve and I had a locally version of the website running.\nWhat took me the most time to figure out was obviously (and as foresaw my friend Edouard) which theme to use.\nI had vague memories of the Gitbook project which I liked the chapter-based organization with a nice vertical left side panel. I checked their website and noticed they stopped supporting their self-hosted solution to focus on a SAAS platform. Too bad ðŸ¤· Plus it did not really fit a blog post use case, missing a lot of features I could find elsewhere.\nAfter exploring the Hugo theme showcase I ended up choosing the Congo theme which was appealing to me for the following reasons:\nit has a search bar it has a dark mode the home page can show as a profile page configuration options are crystal clear it uses Tailwind and I heard it\u0026rsquo;s the cool new thing. The only non-trivial customization was changing the default flaticon. I had to lookup some other persons\u0026rsquo; blogs source code to find the right file names to use in the static folder of my project.\nRegarding the hosting, I considered for a second deploying everything in my AWS account using S3 and CloudFront. But in the end, GitHub pages is easier to use, integrates seamlessly with GitHub actions, plus it\u0026rsquo;s free (I don\u0026rsquo;t even have to pay for a domain name)!\nMy current development workflow is pushing to the main branch, waiting for the GitHub action to generate the public folder to the gh-pages branch, which is then served by GitHub pages on the domain matching the repository\u0026rsquo;s name. I\u0026rsquo;ll see how this can be improved in the future!\nIn the meantime, if you\u0026rsquo;re curious, you can check this website source code at https://github.com/juliendoutre/juliendoutre.github.io ðŸ¤“\nSee you next time ðŸ‘‹\n","date":"2023-04-03","permalink":"/posts/how-i-built-this-website/","section":"Posts","summary":"I wanted to have my own blog for a long time.","title":"How I built this website"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Julien Doutre","summary":"","title":"Julien Doutre"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"This is the first post on this website!\n","date":"2023-03-31","permalink":"/posts/hello-world/","section":"Posts","summary":"This is the first post on this website!","title":"Hello World!"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"Books I enjoyed reading and recommend checking out!\n","date":"0001-01-01","permalink":"/readings/","section":"Julien Doutre","summary":"Books I enjoyed reading and recommend checking out!","title":"Readings"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
