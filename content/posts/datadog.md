For the past two years, I've been part of the SDLC Security team at Datadog. Our core mission is to secure the CI/CD by providing guidance and tools for other teams to use. If you wanna learn more about what it means in practice, I co-wrote a couple of blog posts about two projects I worked on:
- https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/container-image-signing/
- https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/malicious-pull-requests/

See you next time :wave:
